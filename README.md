# gRPC Microservices with Clean Architecture in .NET 8

This repository demonstrates how to design, implement, and test gRPC microservices using **.NET 8**, following **Clean Architecture** and **Clean Code** principles.

## Key Features:

1. **Understand the fundamentals of gRPC & Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)**  
   This project showcases how to use **gRPC** for efficient service communication. Protocol Buffers (**Protobuf**) are utilized to define service contracts, providing fast, compact, and platform-independent data serialization.

2. **Learn to design, implement, and test gRPC APIs**  
   The repository includes examples of gRPC API design, from defining services in `.proto` files to implementing server-side logic in .NET. Additionally, you'll find unit tests that validate the behavior of the APIs under different conditions.

3. **Implement gRPC microservices in .NET 8 using Clean Architecture & Clean Code**  
   All microservices are built following **Clean Architecture** to ensure a modular and scalable design. The separation between domain logic and infrastructure guarantees that the services remain maintainable and adaptable over time.

4. **Explore and apply communication patterns between microservices**  
   This project implements well-known communication patterns between microservices, including request/response and publish/subscribe. gRPC provides a robust and efficient framework for reliable service-to-service communication.

5. **Build high-performance, lightweight, and low-latency microservices**  
   Leveraging the power of gRPC and .NET 8, this repository demonstrates how to build microservices that are lightweight, performant, and optimized for low-latency operations, crucial for distributed systems in production environments.

6. **Implement global exception handling using gRPC interceptors**  
   The repository includes global exception handling using **gRPC interceptors**, ensuring consistent error management across services. This improves the resilience and debuggability of the microservices, allowing for a more robust system.
